# Library Management System (Java)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is my solution for **Task 3: Library Management System** given in the Java Developer Internship.  
It is a **console-based OOP system** to manage library books and users.

---

## âœ… What I Have Done
- Created a **Book class** with fields (Title, Author, Status).  
- Created a **User class** with fields (Name, UserID, Borrowed Books).  
- Developed a **Library class** to manage collections of books and users.  
- Implemented **encapsulation** using private fields with getters and setters.  
- Used **ArrayList** to store multiple books and users dynamically.  
- Developed a **menu-driven system** for Add Book, Add User, Show, Issue, Return, Exit.  
- Applied **OOP principles** â†’ Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, HAS-A relationships.  
- Wrote everything in a **single Java file** for easy execution.
